I have installed ubuntu like 2nd system, because I had some problems on Virtual Machine. I wasn't able to build my project because of some errors.
So, after I have installed ubuntu I followed the task_03 instructions and installed all the require software and built a project.
In robotic laboratory I have connected my laptop to controller. Here are my steps one by one:
##### 1.Connected my laptop to controller with ethernet cable and configured network adapter (IPv4:192.168.1.11; Net Mask:255.255.255.0);
##### 2.Checked connection via ssh (ping 192.168.1.10);
##### 3.Connected to controller via ssh (ssh admin@192.168.1.10);
##### 4.Connected to controller in file manager to copy my program to it.
##### 5.Executed program via terminal.
## Result you can see in video. (https://youtu.be/CM0XByflqZU )
